# Chapter 1 
## The Four Phase of Project Management
- Project Phases
  1. Planning
  2. Build-up
  3. Implementation
  4. Closeout

## How to Map out a Project
- planning is about defining fundamentals
  - what problems need sloving
  - who will be involved
  - what will be done

### Determine the real problem to solve
  - Pinpoint the real issue the project is actually supposed to fix.

********Identify the stakeholders
- figure out who all your stakeholders are.
  - which function of people might be affected by the projects activities or outcomes
  - who will contribute resources
  - who will benefit from the projects output

Define project Objectives
- When defining objectives
  - Specific
  - Measurable
  - Action - Oriented
  - Realistic
  - Time-limited

- Factors to follow while defining your projects objectives:
  - Quality
    - Identify quality standards
  - Organization
    - Calibrate golas depending on the people and other resources available
  - Communication
    - Determine what information each stakeholders needs and how to deliver it

Determine scope, resources, and major tasks
- most projects fail because they bite off more than they chew.
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
  - will help in the process of determining scope and tasks and developing estimates.
  - Subdivide complex activities into their most manageable units
    - Ask "What will have to be done in order to accomplish X"
    - continue to ask until broken down
    - estimate how long it will take to comple these tasks and how much they will const in terms of dollars and person-hours.

Prepare for trade-offs
  - Quality = Time + Cost
