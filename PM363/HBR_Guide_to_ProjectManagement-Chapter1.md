# Chapter 1 
## The Four Phase of Project Management
- Project Phases
  1. Planning
  2. Build-up
  3. Implementation
  4. Closeout

## How to Map out a Project
- planning is about defining fundamentals
  - what problems need sloving
  - who will be involved
  - what will be done

### Determine the real problem to solve
  - Pinpoint the real issue the project is actually supposed to fix.

********Identify the stakeholders
- figure out who all your stakeholders are.
  - which function of people might be affected by the projects activities or outcomes
  - who will contribute resources
  - who will benefit from the projects output

Define project Objectives
- When defining objectives
  - Specific
  - Measurable
  - Action - Oriented
  - Realistic
  - Time-limited

- Factors to follow while defining your projects objectives:
  - Quality
    - Identify quality standards
  - Organization
    - Calibrate golas depending on the people and other resources available
  - Communication
    - Determine what information each stakeholders needs and how to deliver it

Determine scope, resources, and major tasks
- most projects fail because they bite off more than they chew.
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
  - will help in the process of determining scope and tasks and developing estimates.
  - Subdivide complex activities into their most manageable units
    - Ask "What will have to be done in order to accomplish X"
    - continue to ask until broken down
    - estimate how long it will take to comple these tasks and how much they will const in terms of dollars and person-hours.

Prepare for trade-offs
  - Quality = Time + Cost
  

## Build up : How to get the Project Going
Assemble your teeam
- assess the skills needed for the project, so you can get the right people

Plan Assignemnts
- list skills required and set a meeting with the team talking about who's taking the task
- after giving assignment give them the resource and information to start
- leave them be

Create the schedule
- work backwards and list down first the dates that cant be changed
Tools:
  - Gantt chart
  - Critical Path Method
  - Performance Evaluation and Review Technique Chart

Tips for Delegating effectively
- recognize the capability of your team members
- trust your team ability to get the job done
- focus on results
- consider deligating in a way to develop your team's skill
- delegate to the lowest level to maximize use of resources
- explain assignemnts clearly and provide resources needed for successful completion
- deflect reverse delegation
  - solve problems together

Hold a Kick off Meeting
- call everyone
- go over projects plan and objectives
- encourage people to point out spots where
  - problems may occur
  - improvements could be made

Develop a Budget
  - Personnel
    - ongoing and extra for employees and contract workers
  - Travel
  - Training
  - Supplies
  - Space
  - Research
  - Capital Expenditures
  - Overhead

## Implementation: How to execute the project
Monitor and control process and budget
- look for early signs of problems
- monitor not control
- allow team to workout small projects on their own

Report Progress
- stakeholders want regular updates and status report
- ask how much and what kind

Hold Weekly Team meetings
- ask what is essential to the projects success

Manage Problems
1. Time Slippage
  - falling behind schedule
2. Scope creep
  - time slppage can cause internal pressure to alter the scope of the project
  - When stakeholders want to change, communicate how those changes will affect cost time or quality.

3. Quality Issues
  - Dont rush quality for schedules

4. Peoples problem
  - daily interaction - with individual team members
