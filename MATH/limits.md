Thoughts:
  in limites we want to get infinitely close
  
  when a limit doesnt approach the same value from both sides
    - limit doesnt exist

  Unbounded Limits
    
  Limit value to be different between the function value
  - Function is undefined for some x-value doesnt mean there's no limit
  - when the function is defined for some x-value, that doesnt mean that the limit necessarily exists.

  One Sided limit
    - lim x -> 2 - f(x)
      - from the left

  Using tables to approximate limit values
    Limits
      - tool for reasoning about function behavior
    Tables
      - are a tool for reasoning about limts
      - Gets more precise vs graphs
      - TIP : stimulates the feeling of getting close

  Common Mistakes when creating tables to estimate limits
    - Assuming the function value is the limit value
    - Not getting infinitely close
    - Not approaching from both sides
    - Assuming "Left Side" means "negative"

  Common Mistakes when estimating limits from tables
    - Confusing the limit value with the function value
    - Thinking a limit value is always an integer
      

Summary:
  - Limits
    - we want to get infinitely close
    - Doesnt exist
      - when a limit doesnt approach the same value from both sides
  
Questions:
  Difference between the limit of f at x = 3
  and the value of f at x = 3 

  Why is the limit of a function is undefined
