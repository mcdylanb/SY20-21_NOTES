20. Little's Law : T = I/R
21. 
Given:
	Throughout Rate	: 90 units/180min = 30 units/hr
	Flow Time: 	  1 / 30 min	  = 0.5 hr
	Inventory: 	?
	
Solution:
	I = R x T
	  = 30/hr x 0.5 hr
	  = 15 
22.
Actions 	|	I	| R#/hr | R #/min 	| T
---------------	+---------------+-------+---------------+--
Waiting Line	| 8 		| 30/hr | .5/min 	| 16
Being Served	| 2.475 	| 30/hr | .5/min	| 4.98min
total		| 10.475	| 30/hr	| .5/min	| 20.98
