# Physics and Measurement
- Physics
  - branch of science that deals with the measurement of phusical quantities
  - base on experimental observation and quantitative measurements
  - Uses Mathematics as tool that bridges theory and experiment
  - Fundamenal science
    - concerned with the basic principles of the universe
    - Foundation of other phusical science
  - Divided into six Major areas
    - Classical Mechanic
    - Relativity
    - Thermodynamics
    - Electromagnetism
    - Optics
    - Quantum Mechanics

Objective of Physics
  - Find the limited number of fundamental laws that govern natural phenomena
  - apply laws to develop theories, to aid resulta of future experiments
  - express laws in the language of mathematics

Theory and Experiments
  - should compliment each other
  - discrepancy occurs, theory may be modified
