1.	When do we convert units of measurements?
2.	What do you mean by the so-called, “uncertainties in measurements”?
3.	Distinguish precision from accuracy.
4.	What are significant figures? Why is it important to consider significant figures in conducting measurements?

# Answers
1. When uints are not consistent.
2. Uncertainties are the limitations to measurements for possible errors incurred in the conduct of measurements
3. Precision  - refers to the degree of reproducibility of a measured quantity is measured several times.
  Accuracy - Refers to how close a measured values is to the accepted or real value.

4. Significant Figures
  - Refers to the number of reliably known digits in a number
